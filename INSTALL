From there, you should see a green button that says "Start Now".


1. Copy Module Activation XML file to app/etc/modules/
================================================================================
The file "Metrof_FBConnect.xml" located in this folder needs to be copied to:
  {MageHome}/app/etc/modules/


2. Copy template files to your design folder
================================================================================
The directory "fbconnect" in "design/frontend.templates/" and all files under it 
need to be installed in {MageHome}/app/design/frontend/default/default/templates
or whichever directory your theme is installed in.  The resulting folder 
structure should look like this:

app/design/frontend/default/
.
`-- default
    |-- layout
    |-- locale
    `-- template
        `--fbconnect
           `--customer_form_login.phtml


3. Copy layout file to your design folder
================================================================================
The file "metrof_fbc.xml" in "design/frontend.layout/" needs to be copied to 
{MageHome}/app/design/frontend/default/default/layout/
or whichever directory your theme is installed in.  The resulting folder 
structure should look like this:

app/design/frontend/default/
.
`-- default
    |-- layout
	|   |-- ... other xml files
    |   |--metrof_fbc.xml
	|   `-- ... other xml files
    |-- locale
    `-- template



4. Copy translation file to app/local/xx_YY
================================================================================
Assuming your chosen locale is "en_US" (for English in the U.S.) copy the file 
"Metrof_FBConnect.csv" from "locale/en_US/" into {MageHome}/app/locale/en_US.
Change "en_US" to whatever language your store runs under.  

If no such file exists for your language, copy the file from the "en_US" folder 
into the folder of your chosen locale.  You can then translate the items in 
the CSV file into your own language.

You can also customize the welcome message for your store by editing this file.


5. Refresh your cache
================================================================================
Login to the admin page for Magento and choose "Cache Mamangement" from 
the "System" menu.  Choose "refresh" from the drop down menu and submit the form.


6. Add Facebook App API Key and Secret
================================================================================
You may need to logout of the admin and then log back in before you can 
complete this next step.

Choose "Configuration" under the "System" menu. You should now see a tab called 
"Facebook" and a link under it called "FBConnect".

Under the "Facebook Application Settings", paste your API Key value and 
Application Secret value into the appropriate boxes and click "Save Config".
You can obtain these values from Facebook.
