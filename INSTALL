1. Upload or Copy the module

3. Copy template files to your design folder
4. Copy layout file to your design folder
5. Copy translation file to app/local/xx_YY
6. Refresh your cache
7. Add Facebook App API Key and Secret

Your Magento installation directory will be called {MageHome}

*Note:  This module requires you to have a facebook.com account and a 
functioning application on facebook.com.  You can create an application from 
facebook.com by clicking the link "developers" at the bottom of your home page.
From there, you should see a green button that says "Start Now".


1. Upload or Copy the module
================================================================================
The first step is to copy the contents of this zip file into your Magento 
installation.  The folder "Metrof" should be directly under "app/code/local".

The resulting folder structure should look like this 
{MageHome}
`--app
   `--code
      |--core
      |--community
      `--local
         `--Metrof
            `--FBConnect


2. Copy Module Activation XML file to app/etc/modules/
================================================================================
The file "Metrof_FBConnect.xml" located in this folder needs to be copied to:
  {MageHome}/app/etc/modules/


3. Copy template files to your design folder
================================================================================
The directory "fbconnect" in "design/frontend.templates/" and all files under it 
need to be installed in {MageHome}/app/design/frontend/default/default/templates
or whichever directory your theme is installed in.  

The resulting folder structure should look like this:

app/design/frontend/default/
.
`-- default
    |-- layout
    |-- locale
    `-- template
        `--fbconnect
           `--customer_form_login.phtml

If you have a custom design, and you do not want to use anything that looks 
like the default login page, you can simply copy some lines of PHP code into 
your design wherever you want the facebook login button to appear.

The PHP code is between the lines of slashes (######)
####################################/
		<?php if ($this->getData('use_fbconnect')) { ?>
			<p>Use your Facebook account for super-fast logins.<br/><a href="<?php echo $this->helper('fbconnect')->getLoginUrl();?>" ><img id="fb_login_image" src="http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/images/fbconnect/login-buttons/connect_light_medium_long.gif" alt="Connect"/> </a></p>
		<?php } ?>
####################################

You can also substitue your own graphic, or change the color and size of the 
facebook button by changing the words "medium", "long", and "light".

See: http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Fb:login-button
* [Specify small, medium, or large. (Default value is large.)]
* [Specify white, dark, or light. (Default value is light.)]
* [Specify short for the text label Connect only or long for the text label 
    Connect with Facebook. (Default value is short.)]


4. Copy layout file to your design folder
================================================================================
The file "metrof_fbc.xml" in "design/frontend.layout/" needs to be copied to 
{MageHome}/app/design/frontend/default/default/layout/
or whichever directory your theme is installed in.  

The resulting folder structure should look like this:

app/design/frontend/default/
.
`-- default
    |-- layout
	|   |-- ... other xml files
    |   |--metrof_fbc.xml
	|   `-- ... other xml files
    |-- locale
    `-- template



5. Copy translation file to app/local/xx_YY
================================================================================
Assuming your chosen locale is "en_US" (for English in the U.S.) copy the file 
"Metrof_FBConnect.csv" from "locale/en_US/" into {MageHome}/app/locale/en_US.
Change "en_US" to whatever language your store runs under.  

If no such file exists for your language, copy the file from the "en_US" folder 
into the folder of your chosen locale.  You can then translate the items in 
the CSV file into your own language.

You can also customize the welcome message for your store by editing this file.


6. Refresh your cache
================================================================================
Login to the admin page for Magento and choose "Cache Mamangement" from 
the "System" menu.  Choose "refresh" from the drop down menu and submit the form.


7. Add Facebook App API Key and Secret
================================================================================
You may need to logout of the admin and then log back in before you can 
complete this next step.

Choose "Configuration" under the "System" menu. You should now see a tab called 
"Facebook" and a link under it called "FBConnect".

Under the "Facebook Application Settings", paste your API Key value and 
Application Secret value into the appropriate boxes and click "Save Config".
You can obtain these values from Facebook.
